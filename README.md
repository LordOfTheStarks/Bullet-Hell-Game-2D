**Game Description:**
The game is a shooter-style JavaFX game where the player controls a cowboy who must defend a small village from orcs. The objective is to shoot and defeat as many orcs as possible, all while avoiding being hit by the orcs. The game ends when either the cowboy reaches a score of 200, winning the game, or if the cowboy is killed by an orc.
